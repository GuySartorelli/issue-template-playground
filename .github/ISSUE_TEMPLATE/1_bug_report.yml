        ‚ö†Ô∏è  This is the most important part of the report ‚ö†Ô∏è
        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        - Please, take the time to show us some code and/or configuration that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
        - If the bug is too complex to reproduce with some short code samples, please reproduce it in a public repository and provide a link to the repository along with steps for setting up and reproducing the bug using that repository.
        - If part of the bug includes an error or exception, please provide a full stack trace.
        - If any user interaction is required to reproduce the bug, please add an ordered list of steps that are required to reproduce it.
        - Be as clear as you can, but don't miss any steps out. Simply saying "create a page" is less useful than guiding us through the steps you're taking to create a page, for example.
